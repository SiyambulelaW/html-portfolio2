<h3>Central Intelligent</h3>
<p>This is by far the best movie I've watched. A perfect mixture of comedy and action</p>
<h3>Venom</h3>
<p>The movie is like spiderman which is what i liked but it is a bit more nicer.</p>
<h3>How to train a dragon</h3>
<p>One of my favourite cartoon movies. It envolves humans and dragons.</p>
